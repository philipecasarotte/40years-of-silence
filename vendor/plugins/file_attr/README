FileAttr
========

This plugin let you add a file as an attribute to a Rails model.

Installing
==========

If you just extracted the source into vendor/plugins instead of installing via
script/plugin install, you need to run "ruby vendor/plugins/file_attr/install.rb".

Whatever method you use to install, the plugin will copy a migration to your db/migrate
directory, with the datestamp of when the install script is run (either manually by you
or automatically by script/plugin install).

Before using the plugin, you need to run that migration by issuing "rake db:migrate".

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	file_attribute :picture
end

Usage
=====

In a model, add the line "file_attribute :attribute_name", where ':attribute_name' is the name
of the attribute you want to be a file. See the example above.

The plugin will add the property to the model. For the example above, you could call user.picture.
It would return a FileAttribute instance associated with the picture of thar user.

You could also call user.picture.path or user.picture.remote_file_name to get a path to the file
relative to RAILS_ROOT/public. You could then show the user's picture with
<%= image_tar user.picture.path %>. If you needed to post-process the file, you could get its absolute
file name on the server's filesystem with user.picture.local_file_name.

To set the file, use user.picture= uploaded_temp_file, where uploaded_temp_file is a file uploaded
through Rails. It will create a new FileAttribute, attach the file to it, and attach the
FileAttribute to the property of the class.

If you need to use a regular file (in the server's filesystem) you need to create
a mock class which responds to 'original_filename' with only the basename, not the complete location
of the file (you can pass it through File.basename); to 'size' with the file size; and to 'read', with
the complete contents of the file as a string.

File Name
=========

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	file_attribute :picture, :file => ':model.:ext'
end

Available placeholders:
:model is the lowercased and underscored class for which this is an attribute.
:id is the id of the object.
:attribute is the name of the attribute.
:filename is the name with which the file was uploaded.
:basename is the same as :filename, without the extension.
:ext is the file extension (such as 'jpg') of the original file
